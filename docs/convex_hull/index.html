        <h1>Gift Wrapping</h1>
        <div>
          <p>In computational geometry, the gift wrapping algorithm is an algorithm for computing the convex hull of a given set of points.</p>
          <p>In the two-dimensional case the algorithm is also known as Jarvis march, after R. A. Jarvis, who published it in 1973; it has <b>O(n h)</b> time complexity, where <b>n</b> is the number of points and <b>h</b> is the number of points on the convex hull. Its real-life performance compared with other convex hull algorithms is favorable when n is small or h is expected to be very small with respect to n.</p>

        <div>
          <p>Graham's scan is a method of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane with time complexity <b>O(n log n)</b>. It is named after Ronald Graham, who published the original algorithm in 1972.The algorithm finds all vertices of the convex hull ordered along its boundary. It uses a stack to detect and remove concavities in the boundary efficiently.</p>
